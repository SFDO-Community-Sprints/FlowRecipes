# About Us

We started FlowRecipes at the Dreamforce '22 Commons sprint, in September 2022.
More details on our sprints are in the Wiki section of our Github repo.

# Contribution

* We are always on the look out for Flows to contribute to our library of flow building blocks!
* We would also value any contributions to our documentation that you think would be worth while for admins

For both of these, please feel free to fork/clone the repo and then create a pull request for us. Documentation is in the gh-pages branch. Otherwise we are storing Flow metadata definitions in their own branch.

If you have any other suggestions then please raise an issue in github and we'll use that to track next steps.

Thanks! The FlowRecipes team
