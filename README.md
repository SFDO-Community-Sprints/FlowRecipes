# FlowRecipes
focused on creating recipes to help beginner admins get up to speed on Flow by creating basic building blocks that Admins can then customize for their own Nonprofit or Education processes.


# Project Overview
## Vision & Goals
* Provide a one stop shop for beginner admins/part time admins, getting up to speed on Flow and creating their first flow with the basic building blocks that they can then customize for their business processes.
* Other guidance around what to do/not to do when you're creating your Flows.
* Link to other trusted advice from content creators once you start to get into more advanced Flows and Flow design patterns.
