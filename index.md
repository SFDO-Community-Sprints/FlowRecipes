# What is FlowRecipes?

FlowRecipes is a repo for helping admins get started on Flow. It gives them the basic information and building blocks to get them started on building new Flows, and migrate from existing Workflow rules.

# Who is this for?
Beginner admins/part time admins, getting up to speed on Flow and creating their first flow with the basic building blocks that they can then customize for their business processes.

# Why?

There's a lot of information about Flows online. A LOT :) We don't want to re-invent any of these wheels, but we also know that some admins aren't going to have the time to sift through all of the plethora of info that is out there; they need a few key bits of info to get started.

We want to provide that initial info in a concise format, and then point them to other trusted sources of Flow information once they get past that initial hurdle.

# What are our outputs?

Primarily this set of documentation, which contains
- Some basic getting started information; 
- Links to modules in Trailhead for getting up to speed on Flow; 
- Some (Recipes)[/Recipes] for basic building blocks, as admins look to move/migrate over from Workflow Rules and/or Process Builder to Flow

# What's next?

We have a (backlog)[#] in our girhub repo of what we'd like to keep working on for FlowRecipes. If you want to help, great! Just fork/clone the repo and go from there.
- More recipes!
- A way of automating the install of Flows into your dev/sandbox org
